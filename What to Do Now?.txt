Chagpt -> I need to make backend for a chat application

I am doing it in Express

Give me a proper folder strucutre
proper DB ORMS (Object Relational Models) currently only for making user, and a profile user attached to that user
And proper folder strucutre for views, serializers and api endpoints



---------
So now we have user, create user


Now we wanna make login 


Login -> Access Token
and second Refresh Token

Login -> JWT Access Token => 1day 

if in request -> we have access token -> then api will give response
else -> 401 unauthorized

Refresh Token -> 1 year token, jabh access token 1day (expires) => generate_new_access_token () => it'll give us new -> access token
